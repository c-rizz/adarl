# Useful infos about Nvidia drivers

Depending on your configuration and what you may want to do you could have to play around with Nvidia drivers.
For example to install drivers and compatible cuda/torch/jax versiosn you may want to try different versions with versions.

## Installing specific torch versions
For example when 3000-generation gpus were new torch had to be installed from a specific repo to support them:

```pip install --upgrade torch==1.11.0+cu113 torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113```


## Installing very new nvidia drivers

Also, as of January 2024, to install jax and have it work properly I had to install the newest gpu driver (version 545), which is only available on the cuda repositories.
As such I had to add the cuda ppa with:

```
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
```

and then install:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-545
```
